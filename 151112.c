  /**** BEGIN NOTE ON CODE SHARING
   *
   * There are today a number of different Linux container
   * implementations.  That will likely continue for long into the
   * future.  But we can still try to share code, and it's important
   * to do so because it affects what library and application writers
   * can do, and we should support code portability between different
   * container tools.
   *
   * This syscall blacklist is copied from linux-user-chroot, which was in turn
   * clearly influenced by the Sandstorm.io blacklist.
   *
   * If you make any changes here, I suggest sending the changes along
   * to other sandbox maintainers.  Using the libseccomp list is also
   * an appropriate venue:
   * https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/libseccomp
   *
   * A non-exhaustive list of links to container tooling that might
   * want to share this blacklist:
   *
   *  https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm
   *    in src/sandstorm/supervisor.c++
   *  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xdg-app/xdg-app/
   *    in common/flatpak-run.c
   *  https://git.gnome.org/browse/linux-user-chroot
