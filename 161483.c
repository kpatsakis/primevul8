		 * Clock for the next level. If the current level clock lower
		 * bits are zero, we look at the next level as is. If not we
		 * need to advance it by one because that's going to be the
		 * next expiring bucket in that level. base->clk is the next
		 * expiring jiffie. So in case of:
		 *
		 * LVL5 LVL4 LVL3 LVL2 LVL1 LVL0
		 *  0    0    0    0    0    0
		 *
		 * we have to look at all levels @index 0. With
		 *
		 * LVL5 LVL4 LVL3 LVL2 LVL1 LVL0
		 *  0    0    0    0    0    2
		 *
		 * LVL0 has the next expiring bucket @index 2. The upper
		 * levels have the next expiring bucket @index 1.
		 *
		 * In case that the propagation wraps the next level the same
		 * rules apply:
		 *
		 * LVL5 LVL4 LVL3 LVL2 LVL1 LVL0
		 *  0    0    0    0    F    2
		 *
		 * So after looking at LVL0 we get:
		 *
		 * LVL5 LVL4 LVL3 LVL2 LVL1
		 *  0    0    0    1    0
		 *
		 * So no propagation from LVL1 to LVL2 because that happened
		 * with the add already, but then we need to propagate further
		 * from LVL2 to LVL3.
		 *
		 * So the simple check whether the lower bits of the current
		 * level are 0 or not is sufficient for all cases.
