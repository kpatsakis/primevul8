	 * Sequence numbers should only increase.  Messages get their
	 * sequence number as they're queued in a sending conn.  They
	 * can be dropped, though, if the sending socket is closed before
	 * they hit the wire.  So sequence numbers can skip forward
	 * under normal operation.  They can also drop back in the conn
	 * failover case as previously sent messages are resent down the
	 * new instance of a conn.  We drop those, otherwise we have
	 * to assume that the next valid seq does not come after a
	 * hole in the fragment stream.
	 *
	 * The headers don't give us a way to realize if fragments of
	 * a message have been dropped.  We assume that frags that arrive
	 * to a flow are part of the current message on the flow that is
	 * being reassembled.  This means that senders can't drop messages
	 * from the sending conn until all their frags are sent.
	 *
	 * XXX we could spend more on the wire to get more robust failure
	 * detection, arguably worth it to avoid data corruption.
